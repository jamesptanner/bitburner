// "Minimum Path Sum in a Triangle"

// You are given a 2D array of numbers (array of array of numbers) that represents a
// triangle (the first array has one element, and each array has one more element than
// the one before it, forming a triangle). Find the minimum path sum from the top to the
// bottom of the triangle. In each step of the path, you may only move to adjacent
// numbers in the row below.

// "Unique Paths in a Grid I"

// You are given an array with two numbers: [m, n]. These numbers represent a
// m x n grid. Assume you are initially positioned in the top-left corner of that
// grid and that you are trying to reach the bottom-right corner. On each step,
// you may only move down or to the right.

// Determine how many unique paths there are from start to finish.

// "Unique Paths in a Grid II"

// You are given a 2D array of numbers (array of array of numbers) representing
// a grid. The 2D array contains 1’s and 0’s, where 1 represents an obstacle and
// 0 represents a free space.

// Assume you are initially positioned in top-left corner of that grid and that you
// are trying to reach the bottom-right corner. In each step, you may only move down
// or to the right. Furthermore, you cannot move onto spaces which have obstacles.

// Determine how many unique paths there are from start to finish.
